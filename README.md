# Math Formulas

This is a repository of LaTeX code that has created a document (pdf labeld 
formulas.pdf) storing main important formulas or topics throughout math. The 
specific fields of math covered so far are:

- Algebra
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Pre-Calculus
- Calculus I
- Calculus II (Work in progress)

As time goes on I plan to update each chapter with relevant formulas and topics,
often with examples. 

I recommend downloading the current formulas.pdf as the table of contents is 
interactive. As you click on a section or chapter, it will take you there.
